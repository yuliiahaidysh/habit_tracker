**Habit Tracker with Streaks**

**Task:** Create a full-stack web app using Claude Code.

**Goal:** Deliver a working MVP that demonstrates end-to-end product implementation (frontend + backend + persistence + tests) with Claude Code assistance. Developer chooses stack, database, UI library, and hosting approach (local run is required)

**Business scenario:** A user wants to build consistent routines and needs a simple system to track daily habits, see current and best streaks, and review progress on a weekly/monthly calendar.

**1) Core rules**

- The application supports multiple users
- Each user sees only their own data
- There is no sharing of any kind (no invites, no public links, no shared habits)
- Technology choices (stack, DB, UI library) are up to the developer, but the app must run locally

**2) Functional requirements**

**2.1) Accounts and authentication**

- Authentication must be implemented via SSO only
- The app must support both providers:
  - Google OAuth / OpenID Connect
  - GitHub OAuth
- The app must support logout
- Authentication must persist across page refresh
- On first successful SSO sign-in, the backend must create a local user record automatically
- The backend must persist at least the following user profile data:
  - provider
  - provider_user_id
  - email if provided by the provider
  - display_name
  - avatar_url as optional
- Account linking between Google and GitHub is not required
- If the same person signs in with Google and GitHub, these may be treated as separate accounts unless the developer explicitly implements linking and documents it

**2.2) Habits**

A habit represents a routine the user wants to track

Habit fields (minimum):

- Name
- Description/notes
- Start date
- Status: Active, Paused, Archived

Habit operations:

- Create a habit
- Edit any habit fields
- Change status (Active ↔ Paused, Active/Paused → Archived)
- Delete a habit (optional, but allowed only for the owner)

Business rules:

- Only Active habits can be checked-in
- Paused and Archived habits cannot receive new check-ins
- Archived habits are read-only
- A deleted habit must also remove its check-in history or deletion must be blocked until the habit is archived first. The chosen approach must be documented in README

**2.3) Daily check-ins**

A check-in records that a user completed a habit on a specific date.

Check-in rules:

- One check-in per habit per date
- A user can add a check-in for today
- A user can remove (undo) a check-in for today
- Backfilling past dates is not required
- Future-date check-ins are not allowed

**2.4) Streaks and progress**

The system must calculate and display for each habit

- Current streak (consecutive days up to today)
- Best streak (maximum consecutive days historically)
- Total check-ins (count)

Streak calculation requirements

- A streak is based on consecutive calendar days with no gaps
- If a required day is missed, the current streak resets
- Paused status does not preserve the streak in the MVP. If the user pauses the habit and stops checking in, the streak is broken by the gap
- Best streak must remain as the maximum streak achieved historically

**2.5) Search and filters**

- Search habits by name and description
- Filter habits by status:
  - Active
  - Paused
  - Archived
- Filter habits by "completed today" vs "not completed today" (for Active habits)

**2.6) Real-time communication (WebSocket streak milestone notifications)**

The app must include two-way communication using WebSocket.

Server → client behavior:

- The backend must push streak milestone notifications over WebSocket
- Required milestones:
  - 3 days
  - 7 days
  - 30 days
- Milestones are evaluated when the WebSocket connection opens
- A milestone notification must be sent once per habit per milestone
- If a habit has already triggered a milestone notification before, reconnecting must not resend the same milestone notification
- If no milestone has been reached, no notification should be sent

Client → server behavior:

- The client must send at least one meaningful WebSocket message to the server
- Acceptable examples:
  - subscribe
  - Ack
- The chosen message type and payload format must be documented in README
- The message must affect server behavior in some meaningful way, for example:
  - subscribing to milestone notifications
  - acknowledging a notification as read

UI behavior for notifications:

- Milestone notifications must be visible in the UI
- Acceptable presentation:
  - toast notifications
  - alert banner
  - notification panel

**3) UI requirements (modern, styled, responsive, interactive)**

- Authentication entry screen with:
  - Continue with Google
  - Continue with GitHub
- Main screen with:
  - Habit list
  - Current streak per habit
  - Best streak per habit
  - Total check-ins per habit
  - Today check-in / undo controls
  - Search input
  - Filter controls
- Habit create / edit UI (modal, drawer, or separate page is acceptable)
- Habit details screen or section with:
  - habit information
  - check-in history for the current month
  - streak summary
- Visible real-time milestone notifications while connected to WebSocket
- Responsive behavior for narrow screens:
  - list-to-cards is acceptable
  - compact mobile layout is acceptable

To make "modern, nice, styled, responsive, interactive" checkable, the UI must also include:

- Consistent spacing and typography across major screens
- Visible hover and focus states for interactive elements
- Clear empty states for:
  - no habits
  - no search results
  - no check-ins yet
- At least one visible loading state on a main screen or major data block
- Client-side validation feedback for habit create / edit forms
- Light theme only. Dark mode is not required

**4) Backend requirements**

- Provide an HTTP API that supports all UI flows
- Enforce authorization for every habit and check-in operation
- Enforce authorization on WebSocket connections and milestone notification delivery
- Validate inputs and return clear error responses for invalid requests
- Implement Google and GitHub SSO securely
- Document required environment variables for Google OAuth and GitHub OAuth in README
- Persist data in a database chosen by the developer
- Store dates consistently and document the chosen timezone approach in README

**5) Quality requirements**

- Include automated tests covering at least
  - SSO login success path in test mode using a mock or stub provider response
  - Create habit and create today check-in
  - Prevent duplicate check-in for the same habit/date
  - Authorization: user cannot access another user's habits/check-ins
  - WebSocket milestone notifications for 3, 7, and 30 days
- Basic error handling must be visible in the UI
- Tests must not depend on real Google or GitHub network calls
- The project must start locally with documented commands

**6) Deliverables**

- Git repository with frontend and backend source code
- README that includes
  - How to run backend and frontend locally
  - How to run tests
  - Short API description (README section is enough)
  - How to configure Google OAuth credentials
  - How to configure GitHub OAuth credentials
  - WebSocket message format and milestone notification rules
  - Notes about streak calculation and timezone handling

**7) Optional deliverable:**

- Containerization via Dockerfile and/or docker-compose
- If containerization is skipped because it is blocked on the developer's machine, this must be noted in README

**8) Acceptance checklist**

- A user can sign in with Google and GitHub
- A local user record is created automatically on first successful SSO sign-in
- A user can create, edit, and delete habits
- A user can check in a habit for today and undo that check-in
- The app shows current streak, best streak, and total check-ins
- A user can search and filter habits
- Data is private per user and cannot be accessed cross-account
- While connected, the app receives real-time milestone notifications for 3-day, 7-day, and 30-day streaks
- The same habit milestone notification is not repeated on every reconnect
- The WebSocket flow includes at least one client → server message that changes server behavior
- App runs locally from README instructions
- Tests pass locally

**9) Additional notes for the developer**

- GitHub may not always provide email depending on user settings, so identity should rely on provider + provider_user_id
- Because the streak is strict and daily, the handling of "today" and timezone must be clearly documented
- If the user removes today's check-in, the current streak must be recalculated correctly
- Paused and Archived statuses must not allow new check-ins
